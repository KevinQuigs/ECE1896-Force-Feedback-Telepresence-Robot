The code in this section is responsible for capturing a 1080p (@ 30fps or 60fps) video feed from a webcam attached to a Raspberry Pi Model 4 B. The video feed should be streamed to a webaddress using WebRTC.
The webaddress can be opened in the Meta Quest browser and be locked to the position of the user's head in VR.
